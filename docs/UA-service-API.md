# User Agent Service REST API

This document provides protocol-level details of the User Agent
Service REST API.

# Overview

The User Agent Service provides two sub-components intended to back an
abstract conception of browsing: an HTTP REST API to allow bulk access
to data, and a light WebSocket API to push incremental changes to
clients.  The WebSocket API will be documented separately.

The abstract conception of browsing introduces two high-level
concepts, _scopes_ and _sessions_.  Roughly speaking, a _scope_
identifies a logical or conceptual grouping of browsing behaviour.
For Tofino, a scope corresponds to an open browser window; for a
mobile search activity, a scope might correspond to a single
interaction with the main activity.  A _session_ identifies a single
browsing context.  It takes place within a scope (put differently,
scopes encapsulate sessions) and may have a logical _ancestor
session_.  For Tofino, a session corresponds to a single tab; a tab
spawned by clicking a link with "target=_blank" would correspond to a
new session with the original tab as it's ancestor session.

Scopes are currently allocated as new sessions in Tofino.
Alternatively, use any fixed integer scope (such as scope 0).

Full-text indexing is currently opt-in: see
[POST /v1/pages](#post-v1pages).  The data store will return
snippets, which for now are HTML escaped string with bold tags
wrapping highlighted words.  It's safe to use `innerHTML` and
friends to render snippets in privileged UI.

Throughout, timestamps are integer microseconds since the Unix epoch.
Note that this is *not* the output of JavaScript's `Date.now()`!  Use
a higher-resolution timing library, or (in a pinch) approximate
microseconds using `1000 * Date.now()`.  The decision to use
microseconds maintains compatibility with Firefox's Places database,
which uses microseconds internally.

## URL Structure

All requests will be to URLs for the form:

    http[s]://<server-url>/v1/<api-endpoint>

Note that:

* The URL embeds a version identifier "v1"; future revisions of this
  API may introduce new version numbers.
* The base URL of the server may be configured on a per-client basis.
* At this time, there is no requirement for API access to be over a
  properly-validated HTTPS connection.

## Request Format

All POST requests must have a content-type of `application/json` with
a utf8-encoded JSON body, and should specify the content-length
header.  Most requests include body parameters, but some have query
parameters.  Over time we intend to migrate to all body parameters, to
be consistent with other Mozilla services.

## Response Format

All successful requests will produce a response with HTTP status code
of "200" and content-type of "application/json".  The structure of the
response body will depend on the endpoint in question.

Failures due to invalid behavior from the client will produce a
response with HTTP status code in the "4XX" range and content-type of
"application/json".  Failures due to an unexpected situation on the
server will produce a response with HTTP status code in the "5XX"
range and content-type of "application/json".

### Page Object Format

Many requests will produce a JSON object representing a page, or a
JSON array of such page objects.  Each such page object will contain
keys

* url - (string) URL of the page
* lastVisited - (integer) timestamp of the last visit to the page
* title - (optional string) last recorded title of the page
* snippet - (optional string) last summary snippet extracted from the page
